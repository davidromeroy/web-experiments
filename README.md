# web-experimentsüåê

## Overview

Welcome to **web-experimentsüåê**! This repository serves as a personal collection of web development experiments aimed at improving skills and reinforcing knowledge in key web technologies. Each folder contains different experiments with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, providing a space for me to explore and test various concepts.

The goal is to have version control over each experiment, making it easy to track progress and revert to previous versions as needed. The experiments can range from simple form handling to more advanced JavaScript interactivity and PHP back-end integration.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **PHP** (using XAMPP for local development)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this repository locally, you‚Äôll need **XAMPP** installed, which includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Specifically, I recommend using **PHP 7.4.4** for this repository to ensure compatibility with the current setup.

### Installation Steps

1. **Download and Install XAMPP**  
   Get XAMPP from the official website: [XAMPP Download]([https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/files/XAMPP%20Windows/7.4.4/)). Install it on your local machine.

2. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository into the htdocs directory of XAMPP:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-experiments.git /path-to-xampp/htdocs/web-experiments
   ```
3. **Start XAMPP**
   Open XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator and start both Apache and MySQL.
4. **Access the Local Server**
   Open a browser and go to:
   ```bash
     http://localhost/web-experiments/
   ```

How to Use the Repository
Each subdirectory contains a self-contained web experiment (e.g., form submission, dynamic tables).
You can open any experiment by navigating to its folder and accessing the index.html file in a web browser.
Version Control
This repository will help me keep track of changes over time, allowing me to experiment with new features and roll back to previous versions when necessary. All changes will be committed with meaningful messages to maintain clear version control.

### **Suggestions for your README**:

1. **Clarity on Purpose**: Make sure to explain clearly that the goal of this repository is to track and test your learning progress. This will help anyone who views the repo understand the intention behind it.
   
2. **Installation and Usage**: Since you're using XAMPP, it's helpful to mention that it's essential to run Apache and MySQL to use the projects, as you did. If some experiments require a database, highlight that in the **Usage** section.

3. **Version Control**: It's always a good idea to emphasize how version control will help track changes. This reinforces the educational aspect of maintaining a repository for learning.
